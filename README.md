Tiny Redis
==========
Redis driver for the D programming language. TinyRedis is fast, simple, intuitive, feature complete, unit-tested, forward compatible, has no dependencies and makes working with Redis trivial.

It supports all of Redis's data types; strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps and hyperloglogs. It also has simple functions for Lua eval, pipelining and transactions.
