Changelog
=========

v2.1.0 (2016-06-10)
----
Bumped up to 2.1, due to new features in this release.
- dub.json has been spruced up to provide feature parity with the Makefile.
- Updated to dmd 2.071. 
- PubSub!
- tinyredis.collections.


v2.0.6 (2015-12-11)
----
Qualified debug statements with `-debug=tinyredis`

v2.0.5 (2015-02-19)
----
Minor bug fix for empty Bulk

v2.0.4 (2015-01-14)
----
This is a minor feature release.

- Added the ability to cast a `Response` to a `(u)byte[]` stream
- Tested on DMD 2.066.1

v2.0.2 (2014-10-12)
-------------------
This is a minor bug fix and feature release.

- Minor changes were made to the encoder. The templated forms of the encoder now
    bypass the single string version. This makes encoding faster, as the single string version checks the 
    entire length of the string for escape sequences. LUA sequences don't need to be especially escaped 
    (unless passed to the single string version). Thanks to a bug report by @arjunadeltoso .
- Response struct now works with foreach_reverse.
- Response struct is now a BiDirectionalRange.
- Benchmark script now correctly reports the reqs/s.
- Minor bug fixes.    

The response struct is now a BiDirectionalRange, and supports opApply in reverse mode.

v2.0.1 (2014-09-19)
-------------------
Fix dub.json importPath. Now the first official release with DUB support. Fix by @rnakano

v2.0.0 (2014-08-28)
-------------------
This is a major release with lots of rewriting underneath the public interfaces. The goal of this release
was to reduce allocations and further split out functionality into different modules, while maintaining 
backwards compatibility with the public interfaces. The results are as follows :

- The encoder has been split into it's own namespace. Various templated functions were added, and the
	request struct has been removed. std.array.appender is used more often. Unit-tests have been maintained
	and the encoder fully passes all previous tests.
- The parser remains as is.
- The response struct is unchanged.
- The connection class has been removed in favor of a couple of functions used with UFCS.
- The redis class brings together the rest of the namespaces.

The benchmarking script has been slightly altered to mimic redis-benchmark. 

v1.2.4 (2014-05-24)
-------------------
- Minor bug fix
 
v1.2.3 (2013-08-25)
